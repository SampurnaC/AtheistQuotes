"Isn&apos;t it a remarkable coincidence almost everyone has the same religion as their parents? And it always just happens to be the right religion. Religions run in families.

"All thinking men are atheists-Ernest Hemingway"
"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I&apos;ve been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say that one is an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn&apos;t have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or agnostic.

"Secularism is a religion, a religion that is understood. It has no mysteries, no mumblings, no priests, no ceremonies, no falsehoods, no miracles, and no persecutions. It considers the lilies of the field, and takes thought for the morrow. It says to the whole world, Work that you may eat, drink, and be clothed; work that you may enjoy; work that you may not want; work that you may give and never need.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"One of the foundation stones of our faith is the Old Testament. If that book is not true, if its authors were unaided men, if it contains blunders and falsehoods, then that stone crumbles to dust...The Old Testament must be thrown aside. It is no longer a foundation. It has crumbled.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"An honest god is the noblest work of man. ... God has always resembled his creators. He hated and loved what they hated and loved and he was invariably found on the side of those in power. ... Most of the gods were pleased with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered a divine perfume-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown and partly, as I have said, the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes. Fear is the basis of the whole thing-- fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand.-Bertrand Russell"
"So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence.-Bertrand Russell"

"Since the whole affair had become one of religion, the vanquished were of course exterminated.-Voltaire"
"I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice: the sacrifice of all freedom, all price, all self-confidence of spirit; it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation...-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"Man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bullfights, and crucifixions he has so far felt best on earth; and when he invented hell for himself, behold, that was his very heaven.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"A certain sense of cruelty towards oneself and others is Christian; hatred of those who think differently; the will to persecute. Mortal hostility against the masters of the earth, against the &apos;noble&apos;, that is also Christian. Hatred of mind, of pride, courage, freedom, libertinage of mind, is Christian; hatred of the sense, of the joy of the senses, of joy in general is Christian.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"The Christian resolution to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"I call Christianity the *one* great curse, the *one* great intrinsic depravity, the *one* great instinct for revenge for which no expedient is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, *petty*-- I call it the *one* mortal blemish of mankind.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"Belief means not wanting to know what is true.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"Here the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire.-Friedrich Nietzsche"
"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments; there are consequences.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"If Christ, in fact, said &quot;I came not to bring peace but a sword,&quot; it is the only prophecy in the New Testament that has been literally fulfilled.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"The book, called the Bible, is filled with passages equally horrible, unjust and atrocious. This is the book to be read in schools in order to make our children loving, kind and gentle! This is the book they wish to be recognized in our Constitution as the source of all authority and justice!-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"As long as woman regards the Bible as the charter of her rights, she will be the slave of man. The bible was not written by a woman. Within its leaves there is nothing but humiliation and shame for her.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"Our ignorance is God; what we know is science.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"If a man would follow, today, the teachings of the Old Testament, he would be a criminal. If he would follow strictly the teachings of the New, he would be insane.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"The intellectual advancement of man depends on how often he can exchange an old superstition for a new truth.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"Religion supports nobody. It has to be supported. It produces no wheat, no corn; it ploughs no land; it fells no forests. It is a perpetual mendicant. It lives on the labors of others, and then has the arrogance to pretend that it supports the giver.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"If all the historic books of the Bible were blotted from the memory of mankind, nothing of value would be lost...I do not see how it is possible for an intelligent human being to conclude that the Song of Solomon is the work of God, and that the tragedy of Lear was the work of an uninspired man.-Robert G. Ingersoll"
"The universe may have a purpose, but nothing we know suggests that, if so, this purpose has any similarity to ours.-Bertrand Russell"
"Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear. It is partly the terror of the unknown, and partly the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes. Fear is the basis of the whole thing- fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand-in-hand-Bertrand Russell"
"The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way. Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic.-Bertrand Russell"
"What a queer thing is Christian salvation! Believing in firemen will not save a burning house; believing in doctors will not make one well, but believing in a savior saves men. Fudge!-Lemuel K. Washburn"
"The character of God would stand vastly higher in human estimation if he had visited the garden in which he had placed the first human pair and picked up the serpent and cast him over the garden wall before he had a chance to tempt Eve, instead of waiting until the mischief was done, and then cursing the whole lot for what he might so easily have prevented.-Lemuel K. Washburn"
"Civilization has come about by going to school more than to church.-Lemuel K. Washburn"
"A great many people who worship Jesus would not let him come at the back door.-Lemuel K. Washburn"
"A one sentence definition of mythology? &quot;Mythology&quot; is what we call someone else&apos;s religion.-Joseph Campbell"
"The night of December 25, to which date the Nativity of Christ was ultimately assigned, was exactly that of the birth of the Persian savior Mithra, who, as an incarnation of eternal light, was born the night of the winter solstice (then dated December 25) at midnight, the instant of the turn of the year from increasing darkness to light.-Andrew Carnegie"

"Faith is a euphemism for prejudice and religion is a euphemism for superstition.-Paul Keller"
"Each religion, so dear to those whose life it sanctifies, and fulfilling so necessary a function in the society that has adopted it, necessarily contradicts every other religion, and probably contradicts itself.-George Santayana"
"A careful study of religious beliefs and practices, as well as of scholars&apos; definitions of religion, forces us to conclude that the beliefs and practices labeled &quot;religious&quot; have only one thing in common: the beliefs lack any empirical or statistical evidence, and the practices are &quot;regular, habitual, and predictable ways of meeting the unpredictable, the impossible, or the uncontrollable ..., if [these] are momentous.-G.B. Vetter"
"It is interesting that every time God gives direct orders to anyone, it is always &quot;Thou shalt kill.-Newsweek Magazine"
"By one count there are some 700 scientists with respectable academic credentials (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists, less than 0.2%) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared &quot;abruptly.-Newsweek Magazine"

"God, Satan, Paradise, and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth year, when I quite abruptly lost my faith. [...]and afterwards, to prove my new-found atheism, I bought myself a rather tasteless ham sandwich, and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of the swine. No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down. [...] From that day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly secular person.-Salman Rushdie"

"Although the time of death is approaching me, I am not afraid of dying and going to Hell or (what would be considerably worse) going to the popularized version of Heaven. I expect death to be nothingness and, for removing me from all possible fears of death, I am thankful to atheism.-Isaac Asimov"
"To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today.-Isaac Asimov"
"You will find men like him in all of the world&apos;s religions. They know that we represent reason and science, and, however confident they may be in their beliefs, they fear that we will overthrow their gods. Not necessarily through any deliberate act, but in a subtler fashion. Science can destroy a religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the nonexistance of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now.-Arthur C. Clarke"
"Anyone who can worship a trinity and insist that his religion is a monotheism can believe anything... just give him time to rationalize it.-Robert Heinlein"
"Men rarely (if ever) manage to dream up a god superior to themselves. Most gods have the manners and morals of a spoiled child.-Robert Heinlein"
"God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent- it says so right here on the label. If you have a mind capable of believing all three of these attributes simultaneously, I have a wonderful bargain for you. No checks, please. Cash and in small bills.-Robert Heinlein"
"The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide. It acknowledges that it is not equal to the whole of truth, that it legislates, tyrannizes over a village of God&apos;s empire but it is not the immutable universal law. Every influx of atheism, of skepticism is thus made useful as a mercury pill assaulting and removing a diseased religion and making way for truth.-Ralph Waldo Emerson"
"The god of the cannibals will be a cannibal, of the crusaders, a crusader, and of the merchants a merchant.-Ralph Waldo Emerson"
"Kill one man and you are a murderer. Kill millions and you are a conqueror. Kill all and you are God.-Jean Rostand"

"No man ever believes that the Bible means what it says: He is always convinced that it says what he means.-George Bernard Shaw"
"The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.-George Bernard Shaw"
"If I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man&apos;s only moral commandment is: Thou shalt think. But a &apos;moral commandment&apos; is a contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood, not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments.-Ayn Rand"
"Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dolars, the best way would be to start his own religion.-L. Ron Hubbard"
"The more I study religions the more I am convinced that man never worshipped anything but himself-Sir Richard F. Burton"

"I&apos;ve begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It&apos;s there for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, a lovely day. There&apos;s no mystery, no one asks for money, I don&apos;t have to dress up, and there&apos;s no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to &quot;God&quot; are all answered at about the same 50-percent rate.-George Carlin"
"If churches want to play the game of politics, let them pay admission like everyone else-George Carlin"
"I&apos;m completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death.-George Carlin"
"The Bible has been interpreted to justify such evil practices as, for example, slavery, the slaughter of prisoners of war, the sadistic murders of women believed to be witches, capital punishment for hundreds of offenses, polygamy, and cruelty to animals. It has been used to encourage belief in the grossest superstition and to discourage the free teaching of scientific truths. We must never forget that both good and evil flow from the Bible. It is therefore not above criticism.-Steve Allen"
"There are hundreds of millions who believe the Messiah has come. If he did, then it is unfortunately the case that his heroic sacrifice and death have had no effect whatsoever on the very problem his coming might have been expected to address, for history demonstrates, beyond question, that we Christians have been just as dangerous, singly and en masse, as non-Christians.-Steve Allen"
"Prayers never bring anything... They may bring solace to the sap, the bigot, the ignorant, the aboriginal, and the lazy- but to the enlightened it is the same as asking Santa Claus to bring you something for Christmas-W.C. Fields"
"I&apos;m sickened by all religions. Religion has divided people. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any difference between the pope wearing a large hat and parading around with a smoking purse and an African painting his face white and praying to a rock.-Howard Stern"
"Surprisingly, recent research suggests that a religious person is more likely to commit a crime than a non-religious person. One can even argue that the more religious the society, the more likely it is to have high crime rates.-Lisa Conyers"
"An atheist doesn&apos;t have to be someone who thinks he has a proof that there can&apos;t be a god. He only has to be someone who believes that the evidence on the God question is at a similar level to the evidence on the werewolf question.-John McCarthy"
"Since the early days, [the church] has thrown itself violently against every effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad laws, bad social theories, bad institutions. It was, for centuries, an apologist for slavery, as it was an apologist for the divine right of kings.-H.L.Mencken"
"What is the function that a clergyman performs in the world? Answer: he gets his living by assuring idiots that he can save them from an imaginary hell. It&apos;s a business almost indistinguishable from that of a seller of snake-oil for rheumatism.-H.L.Mencken"
"The trouble with Communism is the Communists, just as the trouble with Christianity is the Christians.-H.L.Mencken"
"There is, in fact, nothing about religious opinions that entitles them to any more respect than other opinions get. On the contrary, they tend to be noticeably silly.-H.L.Mencken"
"Religion is fundamentally opposed to everything I hold in veneration- courage, clear thinking, honesty, fairness, and above all, love of the truth.-H.L.Mencken"
"It is now quite lawful for a Catholic woman to avoid pregnancy by a resort to mathematics, though she is still forbidden to resort to physics or chemistry.-H.L.Mencken"
"I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind--that its modest and greatly overestimated services on the ethical side have been more than overcome by the damage it has done to clear and honest thinking.-H.L.Mencken"
"It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.-Helen Keller"
"In spite of all the yearnings of men, no one can produce a single fact or reason to support the belief in God and in personal immortality.-Clarence Darrow"
"If God is love, and if God is also omnipresent, then the Devil cannot exist. If the Devil exists, God cannot be love and also be omnipresent. Yet, an omnipresent God of love and the Devil are both said to exist. It doesn&apos;t take Sherlock Holmes to figure that there is something wrong here!-Rev. Donald Morgan"
"At the time of its Founding, the United States seemed to be an infertile ground for religion. Many of the nation&apos;s leaders- include George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin- were not Christians, did not accept the authority of the Bible, and were hostile to organized religion. The attitude of the general public was one of apathy: in 1776, only 5 percent of the population were participating members of churches.-Ian Robertson"
"Science has proof without any certainty. Creationists have certainty without any proof-Ashley Motague"
"The very concept of sin comes from the bible. Christianity offers to solve a problem of its own making! Would you be thankful to a person who cut you with a knife in order to sell you a bandage?-Dan Barker"

"Formerly, when religion was strong and science weak, men mistook magic for medicine; now, when science is strong and religion weak, men mistake medicine for magic.-Thomas Szasz"

"If there is a God, atheism must strike Him as less of an insult than religion.-Edmond and Jules do Goncourt"
"The central problem of Christianity is: if the Messiah has come, why is the world so evil? For Judaism, the problem is:if the world is so evil, why does the Messiah not come?-Seymour Siegel"
"Geology shows that fossils are of different ages. Paleontology shows a fossil sequence, the list of species represented changes through time. Taxonomy shows biological relationships among species. Evolution is the explanation that threads it all together. Creationism is the practice of squeeezing one&apos;s eyes shut and wailing &quot;does not!-unknown"
"The prime necessity of a human being is freedom. It is the state which has forbidden women from enjoying that liberty. Religion is now the first obstacle to women&apos;s advancement. Religion pulls human beings backwards, it goes against science and progressiveness. Religion engulfs people with a fear of the supernatural, It bars people from laughing and never allows people to exercise their choice.-Taslima Nasrin"
"Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to.-George Seaton"
"You can cite a hundred references to show that the biblical God is a bloodthirsty tyrant, but if they can dig up two or three verses that say &quot;God is love,&quot; they will claim that *you* are taking things out of context!-Dan Barker"
"I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator.-Adolph Hitler"
"Kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. But all the young girls who have not known man ... , keep alive for yourselves.-Moses relaying God&apos;s orders. Numbers 31:17-18."
"When Yahweh your god has settled you in the land you&apos;re about to occupy, and driven out many infidels before you...you&apos;re to cut them down and exterminate them. You&apos;re to make no compromise with them or show them any mercy-Deut. 7:1 "
"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.-Jesus, Luke 19:27"
"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword.-Jesus, Matthew 10:34"
"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?-Richard Dawkins"
"Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where&apos;s the harm? September 11th changed all that. Revealed faith is not harmless nonsense, it can be lethally dangerous nonsense. Dangerous because it gives people unshakeable confidence in their own righteousness. Dangerous because it gives them false courage to kill themselves, which automatically removes normal barriers to killing others. Dangerous because it teaches enmity to others labelled only by a difference of inherited tradition. And dangerous because we have all bought into a weird respect, which uniquely protects religion from normal criticism. Let&apos;s now stop being so damned respectful!-Richard Dawkins"
"Bush and bin Laden are really on the same side: the side of faith and violence against the side of reason and discussion. Both have implacable faith that they are right and the other is evil. Each believes that when he dies he is going to heaven. Each believes that if he could kill the other, his path to paradise in the next world would be even swifter.-Richard Dawkins"
"Just because science so far has failed to explain something, such as consciousness, to say it follows that the facile, pathetic explanations which religion has produced somehow by default must win the argument is really quite ridiculous.-Richard Dawkins"
"An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.-Richard Dawkins"
"It would be deeply depressing if the only way children could get moral values was from religion. Either from scripture, and God knows we don&apos;t want them to get it from scripture, I mean, just look at scripture. Or, from being afraid of God, being intimidated by God. Anybody who is good for only those two reasons is not really being good at all. Why not teach children things like the Golden Rule, do as you would be done by, how would you like it if other children did that to you, so why do you do it to them... I think it&apos;s depressing that anybody should suggest that you actually need God in order to be moral. I would hope that our morals come from a better source than that, and therefore they are genuinely moral rather than based on outmoded scripture, or based on fear.-Richard Dawkins"
"Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.-Richard Dawkins"
"Today the theory of evolution is about as much open to doubt as the theory that the earth goes round the sun.-Richard Dawkins"
"Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not.-Richard Dawkins"
"if there is only one Creator who made the tiger and the lamb, the cheetah and the gazelle, what is He playing at? Is he a sadist who enjoys spectator blood sports? -Richard Dawkins"
"To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough. To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.-Richard Dawkins"
"One of the things that is wrong with religion is that it teaches us to be satisfied with answers which are not really answers at all.-Richard Dawkins"
"If God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who&apos;s God trying to impress? Presumably himself, since he is judge and jury, as well as execution victim.-Richard Dawkins"
"Oh, but of course the story of Adam and Eve was only ever symbolic, wasn&apos;t it? Symbolic?! So Jesus had himself tortured and executed for a symbolic sin by a non-existent individual? Nobody not brought up in the faith could reach any verdict other than &quot;barking mad&quot;-Richard Dawkins"
"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.-Richard Dawkins"
"A God capable of continuously monitoring and controlling the individual status of every particle in the universe cannot be simple. His existence is going to need a mammoth explanation in its own right.-Richard Dawkins"

"A man is accepted into a church for what he believes and he is turned out for what he knows.-Mark Twain"
"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.-Seneca the Younger"
"If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.-Isaac Asimov"

"Two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer.-Anonymous"
"Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even if religion vanished; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men.-Francis Bacon"
"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. -Richard Dawkins"
"A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God who interfered with human freedom and creativity was tyrant. If God is seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect. he becomes a being, not Being itself. An omnipotent, all‐knowing tyrant is not so different from earthly dictators who make everything and everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled. An atheism that rejects such a God is amply justified.-Karen Armstrong"
"All the biblical miracles will at last disappear with the progress of science.-Matthew Arnold"
"Be thankful that you have a life, and forsake your vain and presumptuous desire for a second one.-Richard Dawkins"

"As far as I can tell from studying the scriptures, all you do in heaven is pretty much just sit around all day and praise the Lord. I don’t know about you, but I think that after the first, oh, I don’t know, 50,000,000 years of that I’d start to get a little bored.-Rick Reynolds"

"God should be executed for crimes against humanity-Bryan Gutierrez"
"To say that atheism requires faith is as dim-witted as saying that disbelief in pixies or leprechauns takes faith. Even if Einstein himself told me there was an elf on my shoulder, I would still ask for proof and I wouldn’t be wrong to ask-Geoff Mather"

"We are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.-Richard Dawkins"
"A believer states everything must have a creator but fail to say how he was created.-Anonymous"
"People will then often say, ‘But surely it’s better to remain an Agnostic just in case?’ This, to me, suggests such a level of silliness and muddle that I usually edge out of the conversation rather than get sucked into it. (If it turns out that I’ve been wrong all along, and there is in fact a god, and if it further turned out that this kind of legalistic, cross-your-fingers-behind-your-back, Clintonian hair-splitting impressed him, then I think I would choose not to worship him anyway.)-Douglas Adams"

I personally want to make the world a better place without reward after death. A good deed in and of itself is a reward.-Jay"

"Life is good. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.

"Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion.

But if we just happen be be here by random chance, then the lives we have are truly something to value, enjoy, and celebrate.-Raabco"
"People have suffered and become insane for centuries by the thought of eternal punishment after death. Wouldn&apos;t it be better to depend on blind matter (...) than by a god who puts out traps for people, invites them to sin, and allows them to sin and commit crimes he could prevent. Only to finally get the barbarian pleasure to punish them in an excessive way, of no use for himself, without them changing their ways and without their example preventing others from committing crimes.-Baron d`Holbach"

"If we go back to the beginning, we shall find that ignorance and fear created the gods; that fancy, enthusiasm, or deceit adorned them; that weakness worships them; that credulity preserves them and that custom, respect and tyranny support them in order to make the blindness of men serve their own interests. If the ignorance of nature gave birth to gods, the knowledge of nature is calculated to destroy them.-Baron D’Holbach"

"In dark ages people are best guided by religion, as in a pitch-black night a blind man is the best guide; he knows the roads and paths better than a man who can see. When daylight comes, however, it is foolish to use blind, old men as guides.-Heinrich Heine"

"Christianity: The belief that some cosmic Jewish Zombie can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him that you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree.-Unknown"

"When I point out fallacies in religious logic, adherents tell me that the human brain cannot comprehend God. They also tell me that God created the human brain. God is clearly inept.-Matthew Benjamin Smith"
"Thus I came... to a deep religiosity, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of 12. Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached a conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true...

"The most preposterous notion that H. sapiens has ever dreamed up is that the Lord God of Creation, Shaper and Ruler of all the Universes, wants the saccharine adoration of His creatures, can be swayed by their prayers, and becomes petulant if He does not receive this flattery.

Apart from that he never visits anymore.-Emile de Bergerac"
"So let me get this straight, the unending, all-powerful force of creation that hand-made the universe funneled himself into the body of a human fetus and then teleported the fetus into the uterus of a married virgin. He then spent 30 years on earth walking around doing basically nothing and then one day rearranged reality to set in motion events that would lead to his own death...effectively committing suicide. He does this because his death will, for some or other reason, clear humanity&apos;s sin tally (which he, himself is keeping up in heaven). And then after his plans to get himself killed fall into place, he looks around and asks himself why he has abandoned himself? Is that the basic gist of it? -Hank Guerin"

"A few years ago we finally persuaded psychiatrists to remove homosexuality from the list of recognized disorders. Maybe it&apos;s time we started lobbying them to add belief in God to the list. Belief in an angry, intolerant one anyway. &quot;I demand assurances that a given religion will not cause or potentiate mass homicidal psychosis or priestly pedophilia, before we let it indoctrinate helpless children and vulnerable adults. Bloodthirsty, authoritarian theology threatens Canada as much as tobacco, obesity and booze put together. It endangers out planet more than global warming, nuclear winter or rogue asteroids.-H. L.

"“For people with God on their side, monotheists are a touchy lot. . . . In Exodus, Moses gets the tribe of Levi to go with ‘sword at side’ and massacre 3,000 calf-worshippers. And we are supposed to celebrate such a violation of the freedom to worship? . . . Why are they so touchy? The problem is partly that all monotheisms are, by their nature, anti-pluralistic. They’ve got the one true God, and the very latest valid version of his thoughts. It is asking a lot of monotheisms to coexist with other faiths and views. Paganism, on the other hand, is much better suited to modern ideas of tolerance and human rights. Under polytheism you can choose your own god overtly.-Edward Abbey"
"“Whatever we cannot easily understand we call God; this saves much wear and tear on the brain tissues.... Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination.-Edward Abbey"
"“Fantastic doctrines (like Christianity or Islam or Marxism) require unanimity of belief. One dissenter casts doubt on the creed of millions. Thus the fear and the hate; thus the torture chamber, the iron stake, the gallows, the labor camp, the psychiatric ward.-Wayne Adkins"
"“How do you choose between believing in Jesus, Bigfoot, leprechauns, witchcraft, Islam, alien abductions, the Tooth Fairy, gold at the end of the rainbow or the myriad other assertions that people have made over the course of human history?
